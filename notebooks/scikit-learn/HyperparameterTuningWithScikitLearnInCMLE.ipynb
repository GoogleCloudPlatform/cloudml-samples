    "* `job-name` - A name to use for the job (mixed-case letters, numbers, and underscores only, starting with a letter). In this case: `auto_mpg_hp_tuning_$(date +\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")`\n",
    "* `job-dir` - The path to a Google Cloud Storage location to use for job output.\n",
    "* `package-path` - A packaged training application that is staged in a Google Cloud Storage location. If you are using the gcloud command-line tool, this step is largely automated.\n",
    "* `module-name` - The name of the main module in your trainer package. The main module is the Python file you call to start the application. If you use the gcloud command to submit your job, specify the main module name in the --module-name argument. Refer to Python Packages to figure out the module name.\n",
    "* `region` - The Google Cloud Compute region where you want your job to run. You should run your training job in the same region as the Cloud Storage bucket that stores your training data. Select a region from [here](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/regions) or use the default '`us-central1`'.\n",
    "* `runtime-version` - The version of AI Platform to use for the job. If you don't specify a runtime version, the training service uses the default AI Platform runtime version 1.0. See the list of runtime versions for more information.\n",
    "* `python-version` - The Python version to use for the job. Python 3.5 is available with runtime version 1.4 or greater. If you don't specify a Python version, the training service uses Python 2.7.\n",
    "* `scale-tier` - A scale tier specifying the type of processing cluster to run your job on. This can be the CUSTOM scale tier, in which case you also explicitly specify the number and type of machines to use.\n",
    "* `config` - Path to the job configuration file. This file should be a YAML document (JSON also accepted) containing a Job resource as defined in the API\n",
