Welcome to the [AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/) sample code folder. This folder contains samples for how to use AI Platform for notebooks. An enterprise notebook service to get your projects up and running in minutes.


Overview
----------

AI Platform Notebooks is a managed service that offers an integrated JupyterLab environment in which machine learning developers and data scientists can create instances running JupyterLab that come pre-installed with the latest data science and machine learning frameworks in a single click.

The folder is organized by framework: 

 - [Keras](keras/)
 - [PyTorch](pytorch/)
 - [scikit-learn](scikit-learn)
 - [TensorFlow](tensorflow/)
 - [XGBoost](xgboost/)

#### Considerations
* These notebooks are designed to run on Google Cloud Platform's AI Platform for Notebooks.
* We do not gurantee that these notebooks will work with [CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
