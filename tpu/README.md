Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are Googleâ€™s custom-developed ASICs used to accelerate machine-learning workloads. You can run your training jobs on Cloud Machine Learning Engine, using Cloud TPU. Cloud ML Engine provides a job management interface so that you don't need to manage the TPU yourself. Instead, you can use the Cloud ML Engine jobs API in the same way as you use it for training on a CPU or a GPU.

For TPU training, we recommend users to use the sample from [Cloud TPU Demos](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu). And you can follow the [doc](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/using-tpus) to get started with TPU training on CloudML Engine.
