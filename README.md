Welcome to the [AI Platform Training and Prediction](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/) sample code repository. This repository contains samples for how to use AI Platform for model training and serving.

## Attention: **Visit our new Unified repo [AI Platform samples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-platform-samples)**


## Google Machine Learning Repositories

- [ML on GCP](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ml-on-gcp), which has guides on how to bring your code from various ML frameworks to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) using things like [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
- [Keras Idiomatic Programmer](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/keras-idiomatic-programmer) This repository contains content produced by Google Cloud AI Developer Relations for machine learning and artificial intelligence. The content covers a wide spectrum from educational, training, and research, covering from novices, junior/intermediate to advanced.
- [Professional Services](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services), common solutions and tools developed by Google Cloud's Professional Services team.

Overview
----------

The repository is organized by tasks: 

 - [Training](#ai-platform-training)
 - [Prediction](#ai-platform-prediction-online-predictions)
 - [Training and Prediction](#complete-guide-model-training-and-prediction-on-ai-platform)
 
Each task can be broken down to general usage `(CPU/GPU)` to specific features: 

 - [Hyperparameter Tuning](#hyperparameter-tuning-hp-tuning)
 - [TPUs](#cloud-tpu) 
 
Scroll down to see what we have available, each task may provide a notebook or code solution. Where the code solution will have a `README` guide and the notebook solution is a full walkthrough. Our code guides are designed to provide you with the code and instructions on how to run the code, but leave you to do the digging, where our notebook tutorials try to walk you through the whole process by having the code available in the notebook throughout the guide.

If you don’t see something for the task you’re trying to complete, please head down to our section [What do you want to see?](#what-do-you-want-to-see)
