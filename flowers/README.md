Flowers: Image-based transfer learning on Cloud ML
--------------------------------------------------

![Build Status](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloudml-samples-test-public/badges/flowers.png)

To run this example, first follow instructions for [setting up your environment](https://cloud.google.com/ml/docs/how-tos/getting-set-up).

Also, we use Apache Beam (running on Cloud Dataflow) and PIL to preprocess the images into embeddings, so make sure to install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you may follow the instructions in sample.sh.
