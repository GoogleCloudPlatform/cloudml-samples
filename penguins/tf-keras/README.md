# Getting started: Training and prediction with Keras in AI Platform

This code uses [`tf.keras`](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) to train a
classifier on the [Census Income Data
Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). It's designed so
you can run the training on [Cloud Machine Learning
Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine). To learn how to use this code, view
the Getting Started tutorial in one of the following formats:

* Work through the tutorial as [a Jupyter notebook on
  Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/blob/master/notebooks/tensorflow/getting-started-keras.ipynb).
* View the [tutorial notebook in
  GitHub](../../notebooks/tensorflow/getting-started-keras.ipynb). You can
  download and run it in any Jupyter environment you would like.
* Read the [tutorial in the AI Platform
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/getting-started-keras).
